Project overview: In this project, I aim to create an engaging and interactive canvas that allows users to easily decorate a virtual sugar cookie with random shapes. Users can click the mouse to add various colorful and fun shapes to their sugar cookie, providing a delightful and creative experience.  

Key Features:
1. Interactive Canvas: The canvas will provide an interactive environment where users can decorate their sugar cookie.
2. Random Shapes: Users will have random shapes by simply clicking the mouse.
3. Color Palette: Generate random colors from the designed palette.
4. Save Canvas.
5. Clear Canvas.  

Thinking Process:

Hard Part:
Generate random colors from the designed palette.  

I understood the way to generate random colors. In this project, I wanna try to select a random color from the designed palette to fill shapes. However, it's a little challenging to write if() to fill different colors, since there are too many function, including draw 3 different shapes, and mouseClick() function.

Fun Part:
Draw a random shape. 

It's efficient to create function to draw 3 shapes. And then use if(), where the way used in Random Lottery example, to achieve the feature.
